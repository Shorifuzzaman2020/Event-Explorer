## Project Overview  
Event Explorer is a responsive React application that enables users to browse, explore, and manage tech-related events such as tech summits, AI forums, and blockchain conferences. It features Firebase authentication (email/password and Google sign-in), user profiles, and interactive event sliders powered by Swiper.js. User authentication state is managed globally via React Context, and smooth navigation is handled by React Router DOM.
